# Zoom API Version 1

On April 26, 2020, the Zoom V1 APIs will be permanently shut down/terminated and will no longer be in operation.

To prevent service interruptions, you must [migrate to the Zoom v2 APIs](https://medium.com/zoom-developer-blog/your-guide-to-migrating-from-v1-to-v2-apis-d4ded0474c04).

Migrate your business automations onto our more advanced/secure v2 APIs, and ensure your Zoom integrations continue operating normally. As an added benefit, once you migrate, you’ll have access to developer support, a much broader library of APIs, webhooks, and more!

No exceptions will be made and Zoom Customer Support will be unable to assist you if you do not migrate before the deadline.

Read our blog [Your Guide to Migrating From v1 to v2 APIs](https://medium.com/zoom-developer-blog/your-guide-to-migrating-from-v1-to-v2-apis-d4ded0474c04) and [review our new API documentation](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api) to learn the differences between the v1 and v2 APIs, and for instructions how your developer can successfully migrate your integrations to our new v2 APIs.
